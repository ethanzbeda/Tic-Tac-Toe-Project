# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
. Project Overview: Created a console-based Tic Tac Toe game to enhance understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
. Technical Skills: Utilized Python to design and implement the game, focusing on core concepts including conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures.
Key Features:
. Board Representation: Employed a 2D list to model the game board.
User Interaction: Implemented functions for player input validation and move handling.
. Game Logic: Developed algorithms to check for win conditions, handle draws, and manage turn-based gameplay.
. Output: Designed a function to display the current state of the board after each move.
Outcome: Successfully created a fully functional game with alternating player turns and win/draw detection, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and proficiency in Python programming.
